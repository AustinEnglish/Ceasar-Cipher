# Ceasar-Cipher

* The Ceasar Cipher is a very simple cipher. Each letter of the alphebet has its index A->0, B->1 , ..., Z->25. Given an offset(key) roll around the index of the alphebet by that key.
* Ex:  key = 3, word = "hi". Original Positions: h->7+3, i->8+3: k->10,l->11: translate back to numbers -> "kl" as "hi"
